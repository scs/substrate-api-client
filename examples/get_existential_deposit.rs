///! Very simple example that shows how to get some simple storage values.

	env_logger::init();

	let api = Api::<sr25519::Pair, _, AssetTipExtrinsicParams>::new(client).unwrap();

	// get existential deposit
	let min_balance = api.get_existential_deposit().unwrap();
	println!("[+] Existential Deposit is {}", min_balance);
